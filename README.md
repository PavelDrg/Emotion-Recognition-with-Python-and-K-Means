# Emotion-Recognition-with-Python-and-K-Means

Machine learning project for image classification using Python and the K-Means algorithm.

## The Objective of the project

- The main purpose of this project is to develop and implement a system for recognizing human emotions from images, using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. By using a diverse and representative dataset, the project aims to train a model capable of correctly identifying and classifying facial expressions associated with different human emotions.
- At the same time, the project seeks to explore the efficiency and limitations of the K-Means algorithm, used to organize data into clusters and appropriately interpret various images. Thus, the ultimate objective is to develop a robust and accurate system capable of appropriately interpreting human emotions from images, as well as deepening knowledge of machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence in general.

## Details

- A more detailed breakdown of the whole development process is included in the Documentatie.pdf file, from the data acquiring process to the presentation of the code, conclusions and performance review.
- The dataset is uploaded as an archive due to it's size.
